# ECON4360
University of Virginia - ECON 4360 - Empirical Finance - 2011-2014

I taught ECON 4360: Empirical Finance at the University of Virginia from 2011-2014. Because these materials may be still be useful, I've made them available here. ECON 4360 was a course in asset pricing: the first half covered the theoretical basis of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) methodology (Lectures 1-15); the second half covered how to use the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) econometric framework for estimating and testing the validity of a variety of SDF models (Lectures 16-27). Empirical Finance was (still is?) the capstone course for the Finance Concentration offered by the Department of Economics. 

STATUS: Currently, only the PDF Lecture Slides and Student Handouts are available. In the future, I may make additional materials available. If you are *teaching* this or a similar course elsewhere, I'm happy to share additional materials - just e-mail me.
