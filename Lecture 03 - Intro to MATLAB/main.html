WARNING! MATLAB has many, many features and capabilities, so this introduction is neither complete nor comprehensive. But today, you will learn the basics of most of the things you will need to do your work for this course. Today, we'll do some examples to show you the basics of how MATLAB works and get you well on your way to being about to explore the rest of it.</p><p>Exploring MATLAB is fun!  You should feel free to experiment with it. (Don't worry - you won't break it!).  MATLAB is intuitive and easy to use, and the help files can show you how to do just about anything.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">Understanding Basic Windows</a></li><li><a href="#9">Working with Matrices</a></li><li><a href="#26">Working with M-Files - Scripts</a></li><li><a href="#27">Basic Plotting</a></li><li><a href="#33">Working with M-Files - Functions</a></li><li><a href="#36">LOOPS</a></li><li><a href="#48">Basic Optimization</a></li><li><a href="#62">Output Display</a></li><li><a href="#64">What to do Next!</a></li></ul></div><h2>Understanding Basic Windows<a name="1"></a></h2><p>The Command Window is the main control window.  You can enter commands following the &gt;&gt; prompt.  Try it now:  At the &gt;&gt; prompt, enter:</p><pre class="codeinput">3 + 4
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     7

</pre><p>You'll see that MATLAB reports the answer is 7.  Note that since we didn't assign the result to any variable, a temporary variable called "ans" was created to store the result.</p><p>While you can use MATLAB like a calculator, you'll usually want to assign the results of your mathematical operations to variables so you can refer to them later.</p><p>Now, let's assign the result of 3 + 4 to a variable, x.  Type at the &gt;&gt; prompt:</p><pre class="codeinput">x = 3 + 4
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
x =

     7

</pre><p>You'll see that MATLAB now reports that x = 7.  What MATLAB now does is store a variable in memory called "x" with a value of 7.</p><p>This bring us to our next window: The Workspace Window.  The Workspace Window shows you all the variables that MATLAB currently has stored in memory.  WARNING!  What MATLAB has stored in memory are NOT saved - i.e., if you close MATLAB and re-open it, these variables are "lost".  More on saving in a bit...</p><p>Now, try typing the following at the &gt;&gt; prompt:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% y</span>
</pre><p>You'll see can error message that tells you MATLAB doesn't know what "y" is.  Now type at the &gt;&gt; prompt:</p><pre class="codeinput">y = 5;
</pre><p>Now, you'll see that MATLAB has added a variable "y" to the Workspace and assigned it a value of 5.  Note that this time, there was no output displays.  Why?  If you end a command with a semicolon (";"), the command executes "silently" - i.e., no output is displayed.</p><p>You can also see that the history of all commands - those executed silently and otherwise - are displayed in The Command Window.  You can easily repeat earlier commands by double-clicking on them in the Command Window, or repeat/edit them by pressing the up arrow key.</p><p>Now, suppose we want to save the results of our MATLAB session.  At the command prompt, type:</p><pre class="codeinput">save <span class="string">results.mat</span>
</pre><p>Now, you will see a file called "results.mat" in The Current Directory Window.  Notice that MATLAB shows you the "path" of the current folder you are "working in".  You can change this folder by clicking on the drop down menu.  You can also create a new folder.  Creating different folders for different programs and assignments helps keep your work organized. Try it now.</p><p>Right click (anywhere) in The Current Folder directory and select "New Folder".  Rename the folder to "Intro".</p><p>Now move the file "test.mat" into the folder "Intro", and double-click on it.  You have now changed the "working directory".</p><p>Files will always save or load from the current working directory.  Let's try it now.  At the command prompt, type:</p><pre class="codeinput">clear
</pre><p>You'll see that all the variables have been erased from the Workspace. To re-load them, type:</p><pre class="codeinput">load <span class="string">results.mat</span>
</pre><p>You'll see that all of the variables we previously saved are now loaded back into the Workspace.</p><h2>Working with Matrices<a name="9"></a></h2><p>MATLAB is a MATrix language.  All variables represent matrices - even scalars (they are 1x1 matrices) and vectors (they are 1xN or Nx1 matrices).</p><p>Let's create a 3x3 Identity Matrix.  Type at the &gt;&gt; prompt:</p><pre class="codeinput">I = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
I =

     1     0     0
     0     1     0
     0     0     1

</pre><p>MATLAB now stores the variable "I" as a 3x3 Identity matrix.  Note that you can enter matrices directly using brackets with spaces or commas to separate elements and semicolons to separate the rows.</p><p>You can also create matrices quickly by using the following commands: eye, zeros, or ones.  Try this now.  At the &gt;&gt; prompt, type:</p><pre class="codeinput">anotherI = eye(3)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
anotherI =

     1     0     0
     0     1     0
     0     0     1

</pre><p>Now try creating a column vector of 5 ones and assigning it to a variable called "z'.  Next, create a column vector b by hand.  Type:</p><pre class="codeinput">z = ones(5,1)
b = [1; 2; 3]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
z =

     1
     1
     1
     1
     1


b =

     1
     2
     3

</pre><p>You can perform simple matrix operations - it's easy; you just have to know the commands.  Create a matrix by typing:</p><pre class="codeinput">A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
A =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6
     7     8     9

</pre><p>You can take the transpose of A and assign it to B by typing:</p><pre class="codeinput">B = A'
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
B =

     1     4     7
     2     5     8
     3     6     9

</pre><p>You can add A and B and assign the result to C by typing:</p><pre class="codeinput">C = A + B
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
C =

     2     6    10
     6    10    14
    10    14    18

</pre><p>You can multiply each element of C by 4 and assign it to D by typing:</p><pre class="codeinput">D = 4.*C;
</pre><p>Note that element-wise operations are preceded by a ".".  For example, type:</p><pre class="codeinput">E = A.*B
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
E =

     1     8    21
     8    25    48
    21    48    81

</pre><p>Now type:</p><pre class="codeinput">F = A*B
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
F =

    14    32    50
    32    77   122
    50   122   194

</pre><p>You get very different answers.  F is a result of "matrix multiplication", while E results from multiplying the (1,1) element of A with the (1,1) element of B, the (2,1) element of A with the (2,1) element of B, etc.</p><p>Now, suppose we have a system of equations Ax = b, and we want to solve for x.  We can use "matrix division" to solve.  Type:</p><pre class="codeinput">A = [1 2 3; 5 2 8; 9 2 4]
b = [1; 2; 3];
x = A\b
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
A =

     1     2     3
     5     2     8
     9     2     4


x =

    0.2500
    0.3750
   -0.0000

</pre><p>You can also reference particular elements inside a matrix.  The element in row (i) and column (j) of A is referred to by A(i,j).  For example, to get the value from A that is in the first row and second column, type:</p><pre class="codeinput">a = A(1,2)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
a =

     2

</pre><p>You can also get entire rows or columns by using the ":".  For example, to get the first row of A, type:</p><pre class="codeinput">r = A(1,:)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
r =

     1     2     3

</pre><p>This command tells MATLAB to take all the column elements from A that are in the first row.</p><p>The ":" notation is very useful.  Try typing:</p><pre class="codeinput">a = 1:10
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
a =

     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10

</pre><p>Now type:</p><pre class="codeinput">a = 1:0.5:10
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
a =

  Columns 1 through 7

    1.0000    1.5000    2.0000    2.5000    3.0000    3.5000    4.0000

  Columns 8 through 14

    4.5000    5.0000    5.5000    6.0000    6.5000    7.0000    7.5000

  Columns 15 through 19

    8.0000    8.5000    9.0000    9.5000   10.0000

</pre><p>And next:</p><pre class="codeinput">a = 10:-1:1
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
a =

    10     9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1

</pre><p>As you can see, use of the colon can be very efficient.</p><p>There are also convenient functions that are built into MATLAB.  For example, the "inv" command will take the inverse of a matrix.  To solve our system Ax = b again, we can write:</p><pre class="codeinput">x = inv(A)*b
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
x =

    0.2500
    0.3750
         0

</pre><p>Other common functions include "max", "min", "sum", "mean", "std", and "var".  The functions "log", "exp", "sqrt", and "abs" are also built in.</p><h2>Working with M-Files - Scripts<a name="26"></a></h2><p>Most of the time, we won't want to work directly in The Command Window. Why?  Because when you want to execute a sequence of commands, it's inconvenient to execute them one-at-a-time.</p><p>MATLAB will execute sequences of commands that are stored in ".m" files. There are two types - script files and function files.  We'll start with script files.</p><p>Open a new script file by clicking on File &gt; New &gt; Script.</p><p>You should always include "header" lines at the top of your script files that indicate (at a minimum) the file name, a brief description of what the program does, your name, and the date.  You can enter comments using the percent "%" marks.  These are unexecuted lines of codes and are very usuful to remind yourself what files and functions are for.</p><p>Programming code should always be "neat" and well-commented.  You don't need to go crazy with your comments, but as a general rule-of-thumb, you should have enough comments that you are able to come back to a program after a while and not have to spend much time figuring out what it does.</p><h2>Basic Plotting<a name="27"></a></h2><p>First, we're going to illustrate some basic plotting functions.</p><p>Suppose we want to see what u(c) = (1/(1-gamma))*c^(1-gamma) looks like for various values of gamma.</p><p>Create variables that will store two different values of gamma.</p><pre class="codeinput">gamma2 = 2;
gamma3 = 2.3;
</pre><p>Now, create a variable that will store the range of consumption values we want to look at.  The command "linspace" tells MATLAB to create a vector of 1000 values, equally spaced, from 10 to 100.</p><pre class="codeinput">c = linspace(10,100,1000);
</pre><p>Now, create a variable that stores the utility of each of these values for consumption.</p><pre class="codeinput">u2 = (1/(1-gamma2))*c.^(1-gamma2);
u3 = (1/(1-gamma3))*c.^(1-gamma3);
</pre><p>Next, we're going to plot u2.</p><pre class="codeinput">plot(c,u2);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="main_01.png" alt=""> <p>We can also add a title and labels to our plot.</p><pre class="codeinput">plot(c,u2);
title(<span class="string">'Power Utility'</span>);
xlabel(<span class="string">'C'</span>);
ylabel(<span class="string">'U'</span>);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="main_02.png" alt=""> <p>We can also graph different functions on the same plot by using the "hold" command.  It's a good idea to plot different functions in different colors or with different symbols and add a legend.</p><pre class="codeinput">plot(c,u2);
hold <span class="string">on</span>
plot(c,u3,<span class="string">'--r'</span>);
title(<span class="string">'Power Utility'</span>);
xlabel(<span class="string">'C'</span>);
ylabel(<span class="string">'U'</span>);
legend(<span class="string">'gamma = 2'</span>,<span class="string">'gamma = 2.3'</span>);
hold <span class="string">off</span>
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="main_03.png" alt=""> <h2>Working with M-Files - Functions<a name="33"></a></h2><p>Suppose you wanted to plot "many" different values of gamma?  This could get very time consuming...  You can create a function to do tasks that are repeated many times.</p><p>Now, click on File &gt; New &gt; Function</p><p>Now... We're going to create a file called "myfun.m"...</p><p>The first line of this file declares the function name, input arguments, and output arguments.  Without this line, the file would be a script file.  You should save the file with the same name as that listed in the first line here.  Type the following (but without the "%"'s):</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% function [utility] = myfun(c,gamma)</span>
<span class="comment">%     utility = (1/(1-gamma))*c.^(1-gamma);</span>
<span class="comment">% end</span>
</pre><p>Now, let's do the graph again.</p><pre class="codeinput">plot(c,myfun(c,2));
hold <span class="string">on</span>
plot(c,myfun(c,2.3),<span class="string">'--r'</span>);
title(<span class="string">'Power Utility'</span>);
xlabel(<span class="string">'C'</span>);
ylabel(<span class="string">'U'</span>);
legend(<span class="string">'gamma = 2'</span>,<span class="string">'gamma = 2.3'</span>);
hold <span class="string">off</span>
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="main_04.png" alt=""> <p>Note that any variable created in a script file gets stored in The Workspace, while variables created during the execution of a function file are only "temporary".  See how there are no variables in the current Workspace named "c" or "gamma" or "utility".</p><h2>LOOPS<a name="36"></a></h2><p>Now, suppose we wanted to create A LOT of these plots.  We can do a LOOP for that.</p><p>Let's create a column vector called "gamma" that will store all the values of gamma we want to look at.</p><pre class="codeinput">gamma = linspace(2,3,10)';
</pre><p>We're also going to create an NxM matrix "utility" that will store power utility values for N values of C and M values of gamma.  It's always a good idea to initialize matrices that will be filled in with LOOPS.</p><pre class="codeinput">utility = zeros(1000,10);
</pre><p>Now, we'll write a nested FOR LOOP to populate our matrix.</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="keyword">for</span> i = 1:1000
    <span class="keyword">for</span> j = 1:10
        utility(i,j) = myfun(c(i),gamma(j));
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre><p>There is more than one way of doing this.  A more efficient way...</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="keyword">for</span> i = 1:10
    utility(:,i) = myfun(c,gamma(i));
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre><p>Now, let's create a new window and use a loop again to plot these values.</p><pre class="codeinput">figure(2)
hold <span class="string">on</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> i = 1:10
    plot(c,utility(:,i));
<span class="keyword">end</span>
title(<span class="string">'Power Utility'</span>);
xlabel(<span class="string">'C'</span>);
ylabel(<span class="string">'U'</span>);
hold <span class="string">off</span>
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="main_05.png" alt=""> <p>A word on LOOPS - In general, you should ALWAYS use FOR LOOPS.  WHILE LOOPS should be reserved for the rare, but necessary, occassion.  The latter are much more prone to getting hung up in an infinite loop. However...  we all write infinite loops (oops!) from time-to-time.  If you need to break out of one of these loops, CTRL-C or CTRL-BREAK will usually do the trick.  Open up a new m-file and try it now...</p><p>Here's an infinite "while" loop:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% i = 1;</span>
<span class="comment">% while (i &gt;= 1)</span>
<span class="comment">%     disp('Oops!');</span>
<span class="comment">%     i = i + 1;</span>
<span class="comment">% end</span>
</pre><p>Note that the commands keep executing as long as the statement in (..) is true.  WHILE LOOPS can be useful, but they should be used with care.</p><p>While we're at it, for all you computer-junkies, MATLAB uses column-major ordering for storage (as opposed to row-major ordering like C), so it's more efficient to loop over columns first, rather than rows.  It's even more efficient to use MATLAB's built-in functions when possible.</p><p>To see this for yourself, check out the file "test.m"</p><p>It contains the following code fragments:</p><p>Suppose we have a very big matrix and we want to add all the elements...</p><pre class="codeinput">A = ones(10000,10000);

##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Getting Started with MATLAB Programming
%
% MATLAB stands for MATrix LABoratory - it is a matrix-based system that
% allows you to do scientific calculations and programming for tasks like 
% regressions, optimization problems, etc.
%
% MATLAB is NOT the Economics - but it is an excellent TOOL for Economics,
% and we will use it extensively in ECON 4360.
%
% We are going to start with a simple introduction to MATLAB.  WARNING!  
% MATLAB has many, many features and capabilities, so this introduction is 
% neither complete nor comprehensive. But today, you will learn the basics 
% of most of the things you will need to do your work for this course.
% Today, we'll do some examples to show you the basics of how MATLAB works
% and get you well on your way to being about to explore the rest of it.
% 
% Exploring MATLAB is fun!  You should feel free to experiment with it.
% (Don't worry - you won't break it!).  MATLAB is intuitive and easy to 
% use, and the help files can show you how to do just about anything.

%% Understanding Basic Windows
%
% The Command Window is the main control window.  You can enter commands
% following the >> prompt.  Try it now:  At the >> prompt, enter:

3 + 4

%%
% You'll see that MATLAB reports the answer is 7.  Note that since we
% didn't assign the result to any variable, a temporary variable called
% "ans" was created to store the result.  
%
% While you can use MATLAB like a calculator, you'll usually want to assign
% the results of your mathematical operations to variables so you can refer
% to them later.
%
% Now, let's assign the result of 3 + 4 to a variable, x.  Type at the >>
% prompt:

x = 3 + 4

%%
% You'll see that MATLAB now reports that x = 7.  What MATLAB now does is
% store a variable in memory called "x" with a value of 7.
%
% This bring us to our next window: The Workspace Window.  The Workspace
% Window shows you all the variables that MATLAB currently has stored in
% memory.  WARNING!  What MATLAB has stored in memory are NOT saved - i.e.,
% if you close MATLAB and re-open it, these variables are "lost".  More on
% saving in a bit...
%
% Now, try typing the following at the >> prompt:

% y

%%
% You'll see can error message that tells you MATLAB doesn't know what "y"
% is.  Now type at the >> prompt:

y = 5;

%%
% Now, you'll see that MATLAB has added a variable "y" to the Workspace and
% assigned it a value of 5.  Note that this time, there was no output
% displays.  Why?  If you end a command with a semicolon (";"), the command
% executes "silently" - i.e., no output is displayed.
%
% You can also see that the history of all commands - those executed
% silently and otherwise - are displayed in The Command Window.  You can
% easily repeat earlier commands by double-clicking on them in the Command
% Window, or repeat/edit them by pressing the up arrow key.
%
% Now, suppose we want to save the results of our MATLAB session.  At the
% command prompt, type:

save results.mat

%%
% Now, you will see a file called "results.mat" in The Current Directory
% Window.  Notice that MATLAB shows you the "path" of the current folder
% you are "working in".  You can change this folder by clicking on the drop
% down menu.  You can also create a new folder.  Creating different folders
% for different programs and assignments helps keep your work organized.
% Try it now.  
%
% Right click (anywhere) in The Current Folder directory and select "New 
% Folder".  Rename the folder to "Intro".
%
% Now move the file "test.mat" into the folder "Intro", and double-click on
% it.  You have now changed the "working directory".
%
% Files will always save or load from the current working directory.  Let's
% try it now.  At the command prompt, type:
 
clear

%%
% You'll see that all the variables have been erased from the Workspace.
% To re-load them, type:

load results.mat

%%
% You'll see that all of the variables we previously saved are now loaded
% back into the Workspace.

%% Working with Matrices
%
% MATLAB is a MATrix language.  All variables represent matrices - even
% scalars (they are 1x1 matrices) and vectors (they are 1xN or Nx1 
% matrices).
%
% Let's create a 3x3 Identity Matrix.  Type at the >> prompt:

I = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]

%%
% MATLAB now stores the variable "I" as a 3x3 Identity matrix.  Note
% that you can enter matrices directly using brackets with spaces or commas 
% to separate elements and semicolons to separate the rows.
%
% You can also create matrices quickly by using the following commands:
% eye, zeros, or ones.  Try this now.  At the >> prompt, type:

anotherI = eye(3)

%%
% Now try creating a column vector of 5 ones and assigning it to a variable 
% called "z'.  Next, create a column vector b by hand.  Type:

z = ones(5,1)
b = [1; 2; 3]

%%
% You can perform simple matrix operations - it's easy; you just have to
% know the commands.  Create a matrix by typing:

A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]

%%
% You can take the transpose of A and assign it to B by typing:

B = A'

%%
% You can add A and B and assign the result to C by typing:

C = A + B

%%
% You can multiply each element of C by 4 and assign it to D by typing:

D = 4.*C;

%%
% Note that element-wise operations are preceded by a ".".  For example, 
% type:

E = A.*B

%%
% Now type:

F = A*B

%%
% You get very different answers.  F is a result of "matrix
% multiplication", while E results from multiplying the (1,1) element of A
% with the (1,1) element of B, the (2,1) element of A with the (2,1)
% element of B, etc.
%
% Now, suppose we have a system of equations Ax = b, and we want to solve
% for x.  We can use "matrix division" to solve.  Type:

A = [1 2 3; 5 2 8; 9 2 4]
b = [1; 2; 3];
x = A\b

%%
% You can also reference particular elements inside a matrix.  The element 
% in row (i) and column (j) of A is referred to by A(i,j).  For example, to
% get the value from A that is in the first row and second column, type:

a = A(1,2)

%%
% You can also get entire rows or columns by using the ":".  For example,
% to get the first row of A, type:

r = A(1,:)

%%
% This command tells MATLAB to take all the column elements from A that are
% in the first row.  
%
% The ":" notation is very useful.  Try typing:

a = 1:10

%%
% Now type:

a = 1:0.5:10

%%
% And next:

a = 10:-1:1

%%
% As you can see, use of the colon can be very efficient.
%
% There are also convenient functions that are built into MATLAB.  For
% example, the "inv" command will take the inverse of a matrix.  To solve
% our system Ax = b again, we can write:

x = inv(A)*b

%%
% Other common functions include "max", "min", "sum", "mean", "std", and
% "var".  The functions "log", "exp", "sqrt", and "abs" are also built in.

%% Working with M-Files - Scripts
% Most of the time, we won't want to work directly in The Command Window.
% Why?  Because when you want to execute a sequence of commands, it's
% inconvenient to execute them one-at-a-time.  
%
% MATLAB will execute sequences of commands that are stored in ".m" files.
% There are two types - script files and function files.  We'll start with
% script files.
%
% Open a new script file by clicking on File > New > Script.
%
% You should always include "header" lines at the top of your script files
% that indicate (at a minimum) the file name, a brief description of what
% the program does, your name, and the date.  You can enter comments using
% the percent "%" marks.  These are unexecuted lines of codes and are very
% usuful to remind yourself what files and functions are for.  
%
% Programming code should always be "neat" and well-commented.  You don't
% need to go crazy with your comments, but as a general rule-of-thumb, you
% should have enough comments that you are able to come back to a program
% after a while and not have to spend much time figuring out what it does.

%% Basic Plotting
% First, we're going to illustrate some basic plotting functions.
%
% Suppose we want to see what u(c) = (1/(1-gamma))*c^(1-gamma) looks like
% for various values of gamma.
%
% Create variables that will store two different values of gamma.

gamma2 = 2;
gamma3 = 2.3;

%%
% Now, create a variable that will store the range of consumption values we
% want to look at.  The command "linspace" tells MATLAB to create a vector
% of 1000 values, equally spaced, from 10 to 100.

c = linspace(10,100,1000);

%%
% Now, create a variable that stores the utility of each of these values
% for consumption.

u2 = (1/(1-gamma2))*c.^(1-gamma2);
u3 = (1/(1-gamma3))*c.^(1-gamma3);

%%
% Next, we're going to plot u2.

plot(c,u2);

%%
% We can also add a title and labels to our plot.

plot(c,u2);
title('Power Utility');
xlabel('C');
ylabel('U');

%%
% We can also graph different functions on the same plot by using the
% "hold" command.  It's a good idea to plot different functions in
% different colors or with different symbols and add a legend.

plot(c,u2);
hold on
plot(c,u3,'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHr');
title('Power Utility');
xlabel('C');
ylabel('U');
legend('gamma = 2','gamma = 2.3');
hold off

%% Working with M-Files - Functions
% Suppose you wanted to plot "many" different values of gamma?  This could
% get very time consuming...  You can create a function to do tasks that
% are repeated many times.
%
% Now, click on File > New > Function
%
% Now... We're going to create a file called "myfun.m"...
%
% The first line of this file declares the function name, input arguments,
% and output arguments.  Without this line, the file would be a script
% file.  You should save the file with the same name as that listed in the
% first line here.  Type the following (but without the "%"'s):

% function [utility] = myfun(c,gamma)
%     utility = (1/(1-gamma))*c.^(1-gamma);
% end

%%
% Now, let's do the graph again.

plot(c,myfun(c,2));
hold on
plot(c,myfun(c,2.3),'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHr');
title('Power Utility');
xlabel('C');
ylabel('U');
legend('gamma = 2','gamma = 2.3');
hold off

%%
% Note that any variable created in a script file gets stored in The
% Workspace, while variables created during the execution of a function
% file are only "temporary".  See how there are no variables in the current
% Workspace named "c" or "gamma" or "utility".

%% LOOPS
% Now, suppose we wanted to create A LOT of these plots.  We can do a LOOP
% for that.
%  
% Let's create a column vector called "gamma" that will store all the
% values of gamma we want to look at.

gamma = linspace(2,3,10)';

%%
% We're also going to create an NxM matrix "utility" that will store power
% utility values for N values of C and M values of gamma.  It's always a
% good idea to initialize matrices that will be filled in with LOOPS.

utility = zeros(1000,10);

%%
% Now, we'll write a nested FOR LOOP to populate our matrix.

for i = 1:1000
    for j = 1:10
        utility(i,j) = myfun(c(i),gamma(j));
    end
end

%%
% There is more than one way of doing this.  A more efficient way...

for i = 1:10
    utility(:,i) = myfun(c,gamma(i));
end

%%
% Now, let's create a new window and use a loop again to plot these values.

figure(2)
hold on
for i = 1:10
    plot(c,utility(:,i));
end
title('Power Utility');
xlabel('C');
ylabel('U');
hold off

%%
% A word on LOOPS - In general, you should ALWAYS use FOR LOOPS.  WHILE
% LOOPS should be reserved for the rare, but necessary, occassion.  The
% latter are much more prone to getting hung up in an infinite loop.
% However...  we all write infinite loops (oops!) from time-to-time.  If
% you need to break out of one of these loops, CTRL-C or CTRL-BREAK will
% usually do the trick.  Open up a new m-file and try it now...
%
% Here's an infinite "while" loop:

% i = 1;
% while (i >= 1)
%     disp('Oops!');
%     i = i + 1;
% end

%%
% Note that the commands keep executing as long as the statement in (..) is
% true.  WHILE LOOPS can be useful, but they should be used with care.

%% 
% While we're at it, for all you computer-junkies, MATLAB uses column-major
% ordering for storage (as opposed to row-major ordering like C), so it's
% more efficient to loop over columns first, rather than rows.  It's even
% more efficient to use MATLAB's built-in functions when possible.
%
% To see this for yourself, check out the file "test.m"
%
% It contains the following code fragments:
%
% Suppose we have a very big matrix and we want to add all the elements...

A = ones(10000,10000);

%%
% Summing First Across Rows...

tic
mysum = 0;
for i = 1:10000
    for j = 1:10000
    mysum = mysum + A(i,j);
    end
end
toc

mysum = 0;

end

%%
% Using Built-In Functions...

tic
mysum = 0;
mysum = sum(sum(A));

%% 
% How fast does your computer solve these problems?

%% Basic Optimization
% Now, on to optimization.  To find the "zero" of a function, we can use
% the command "fzero".  We have to specify the function and where we want
% MATLAB to start looking for the answer.

x = fzero(@(x)x^3-5,0)

%%
% We can also write our own functions and use them with this command.
%
% Create a new function with the following:

% function [value] = myfun2(x) 
%     value = x^3 - 5;
% end

%%
% Then try:

x = fzero(@myfun2,0)

%%
% The command "fsolve" will do the same thing for functions of more than
% one variable. Create a new function

% function [value] = myfun3(X)
% 
%     x = X(1);
%     y = X(2);
% 
%     value(1) = x^3 - 5;
%     value(2) = y + 5;
% 
% end

%%
% Here, we also have to set options for our solver.  We have to specify how
% many iterations (at most) we want MATLAB to try, and how close is "close 
% enough" to zero.  Now try:
 
X0 = [1.7; -5];
options = optimset('maxiter',10000,'tolfun',1e-8,'tolx',1e-8);
[answer fval exitflag output] = fsolve(@myfun3,X0,options)

%%
% Note that "fval" will give you the value of the function at the solution.
% You should always check that this is close to zero.  The variable
% "exitflag" should be 1 if a solution was found.  You can check the help
% file for the meaning of other errors.  The variable "output" contains
% information about the algorithm and the iterations.
%
% Note that MATLAB is smart, but it's not that smart..  A good initial
% guess can make the difference between finding a solution and not finding
% a solution.  Try to change the initial guess to the following:

X0 = [0; -5];
options = optimset('maxiter',10000,'tolfun',1e-8,'tolx',1e-8);
[answer fval exitflag output] = fsolve(@myfun3,X0,options)

% MATLAB can't find the solution now.  Why?  Let's investigate.  Plot the
% function we're working with.

x = linspace(-5,5,1000);

figure(3)
plot(x,x.^3-5);
hold on
plot(x,zeros(1000,1),'r');

%%
% MATLAB is having trouble finding that little dip - the basic solution is 
% to try different starting values.

%% 
% We can also use MATLAB to solve maximization and minimization problems.
% Suppose we want to find the minimum of the function x^2.  We can write

x = fminunc(@(x)x^2,1,options)

%%
% We can also solve min/max problems with constraints.  We can have
% equality and inequality constraints, and they take the forms of A*x <= b
% and Aeq*x = beq.  Suppose we want to impose the constraint that x < -2.
% Then we would write:

A = [1];
b = [-2];
Aeq = [];
beq = [];
x0 = -3;

[x fval] = fmincon(@(x)x^2,x0,A,b,Aeq,beq)

%%
% The function fmincon is very versatile.  It can also take nonlinear
% constraints that you specify through a function file, but we won't do
% that today.  See the help file for the syntax and more informaiton.

%%
% Now, let's see if we can solve a standard utility maximization problem.
% Suppose a consumer has a utility function over two goods specified as
% u(x1,x2) = (1-gamma)^(-1)*x1^(1-gamma) + (1-gamma)^(-1)*x2^(1-gamma), a
% budget of B = 10, and prices of the goods are p1 = 1 and p2 = 2.
%
% First, we want to maximize utility, so we write a function file to
% evaluate the expression for possible values of x1 and x2.  Name this
% function "myfun5.m".  

% function F = myfun5(x,gamma)
% 
%     utility = (1-gamma)^(-1)*x(1)^(1-gamma) + (1-gamma)^(-1)*x(2)^(1-gamma);
% 
%     F = -utility;
% 
% end

%%
% Next, we figure out the constraints.  We have a budget constraint that
% p1*x1 + p2*x2 = B, so we write the following:

gamma = 2;
A = [];
b = [];
Aeq = [1 2];
beq = 10;
x0 = [4 2];
[x fval] = fmincon(@(x)myfun5(x,gamma),x0,A,b,Aeq,beq)

%%
% These minimization routines (fminsearch is another one) are very
% flexible.  We could easily do our maximization problem here by just 
% minimizing the negative of our objective function.

%% Output Display
% We can display our results using the "disp" command:

disp(x);

%%
% Or we can make our output "pretty".  Of course, you should be reporting
% results and writing up reports in programs like Microsoft Word or any Tex
% Editor.  However, formatting your display output can be very useful for
% your own purposes - debugging, etc.  (Will you remember a month from now
% what "x" means?  I doubt I will...)  We can use the "fprintf" command for
% this.  Details can be found in the Help Files for syntax, but you can get
% the basic idea from the following:

fprintf('\n The optimal amount of Good One is %4.2f and of Good Two is %4.2f.',x(1),x(2));
fprintf('\n ');

%% What to do Next!
% So now you've seen the basics of pretty much everything you need to get
% up and running with MATLAB.  You can click on Help > Product Help and
% then search for whatever you're looking for.  We didn't cover file I/O
% today, so you may want to start there and see if you can figure out how
% to read in a basic text file for yourself!
